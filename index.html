        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Krystal Do. I'm currently a 3rd year biology major at Univeristy California of Riverside.<br><br>

        I‚Äôm the type of person who has the remarkable ability to brighten up any room with my affable
personality and lighthearted sense of humor, banishing awkward silences. As an active participant in
sports and extracurricular activities, I never struggled to forge lasting connections with others.
Meeting new people and cultivating meaningful relationships is the essence of a fulfilling social
experience. Having a second family outside of my home was something that I truly relished. My
outgoing nature has also proven to be an asset in my academics, as I have refined my presentation
skills and nurtured close relationships with professors. As a child, I spent countless hours practicing
dance and piano, which meant performing in front of large crowds and judges. Fortunately, this
rigorous training instilled confidence that has been valuable throughout my life. I never imagined that
these experiences would eventually enable me to speak with clarity and charismatically in public
settings. Whether presenting in clubs or working on class projects, I can articulate my thoughts with
ease and confidence, eliminating any sense of awkwardness that may arise.<br><br>

        Growing up I‚Äôve always had a strong desire to pursue a career in healthcare. I‚Äôve found the role of
optometrists particularly intriguing, as they are often the first healthcare professionals to detect early
signs of medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension. As a future optometrist, I aspire to have
the independence of being my own boss and setting my own schedule, and I am confident that their
career path will bring me fulfillment. One of the most appealing aspects of optometry is the ability to
develop lasting relationships with patients, their families, and future generations. In the future, I hope to become an optometrist and open up my own optometry practice. My passion for optometry stems from a young age
due to my struggles with poor vision. By 10th grade, I began working as an optometric assistant at
Little Saigon Optometry where I honed my skills in various tasks such as adjusting glasses, checking
insurance, and assisting in contact lenses training. My experience has equipped me with a diverse
range of skills, including exceptional customer service through daily interaction with patients,
assisting them with appointments, and eyewear selection. Additionally, I possess knowledge of
medical and technical equipment used in the optometry field through pretesting patients before their
exams. I am proficient in using software programs related to patient record and insurance claims, and
I handle conflicts and challenging situations with professionalism and diplomacy. I understand the
importance of attention to detail and am meticulous in ensuring that patient prescriptions, and billing
information are accurate. Furthermore, I have learned to be adaptable to change and new challenges,
such as changes in policies or procedures. As I continue to work and pursue my academic career, I
aim to apply these practical experiences to my future endeavors.
